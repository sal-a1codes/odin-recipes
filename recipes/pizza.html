        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A basic, homemade pizza can be made with simple pantry staples in about 1-2 hours (including rise time).</p>
        <p>The key is high heat to get a crispy crust.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm Water: 1 cup (approx. 110°F/45°C)</li>
<li>Instant or Active Dry Yeast: 1 package (2 ¼ tsp)</li>
<li>Sugar: 1 tbsp (helps activate yeast)</li>
<li>Olive Oil: 1-2 tbsp, plus more for greasing</li>
<li>Salt: 1 tsp</li>
<li>All-Purpose Flour or Bread Flour: 2 ½ to 3 ½ cups</li>
<li>Toppings: 1/2 cup pizza sauce, 1-2 cups shredded mozzarella, and pepperoni/other toppings as desired</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Activate Yeast: Combine warm water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Make Dough: Add olive oil, salt, and flour to the mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead: Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 30-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat & Shape: Preheat your oven to its highest setting—usually 450°F-500°F (230°C-260°C). Punch down the dough and stretch it into a 12-inch circle on a baking sheet or pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Top & Bake: Add sauce, cheese, and toppings. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
